# frozen_string_literal: true

# Homebrew formula for `declaragent`.
#
# Seed template — placeholder tokens (wrapped in double curlies) are
# stamped by the release pipeline before the formula lands in the
# `declaragent/homebrew-tap` repo. See ../README.md for the promotion
# workflow.
#
# The formula serves both macOS arm64 (Apple Silicon) and macOS x64
# (Intel), falling back to the Linux build on Linuxbrew hosts. Every
# download URL points at the GitHub release tarballs produced by
# `.github/workflows/release-binaries.yml`.
